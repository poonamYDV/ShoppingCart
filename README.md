# ShoppingCart

--First we have to set up mongo db for admin data of shopping cart
--install mongodb
--set it to path
--run commands
1-use cartAdmin---here since in node we are using cartAdmin hence name should be same otherwise we have to make changes at both the places
2-db.data.insert({id:'ShoppingCart2020@gmail.com',password:'50aAA#'})--this are admin id password and can be anything as you choose
now exit mongodb
And run node

it is important to note that all packages shoul be imported of node
